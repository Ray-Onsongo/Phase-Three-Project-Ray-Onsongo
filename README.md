# Overview
## Business Problem: Wine Quality Classification
Stakeholder: Quality Assurance Manager, Vintage Vineyards Winery

**Business Context**: Our winery has been experiencing inconsistent quality across wine batches, leading to:

Price reductions for lower-quality wines
Customer dissatisfaction and returns
Inefficient allocation to premium vs. standard distribution channels
**Business Objective**: Develop a predictive model that can classify wine batches as "Premium Quality" (quality â‰¥ 7) or "Standard Quality" (quality < 7) based on measurable chemical properties.

**Business Value**:

Route premium wines to high-margin channels ($25+ bottles)
Identify underperforming batches early for blending or correction
Optimize production parameters to increase premium yield
Estimated potential revenue increase: 15-20% through better quality control 

### Source of data
Our data is named **WineQT.csv** which was fetched from **Kaggle** and we used it for this Project. It includes:
- fixed acidity
- volatile acidity
- citric acid
- residual sugar
- chlorides
- free sulfur dioxide
- total sulfur dioxide
- density
- pH
- sulphates
